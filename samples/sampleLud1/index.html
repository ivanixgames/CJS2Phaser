        <h3>The truth about Santa</h1>
        <p>It's that time of year again where children from all over the wold
         await in anticipation for the presents that Santa will bring, assuming he or she has been 
        good all year. However, behind the merry story of Santa lies a dark secret.  The story goes that Santa uses eight flying reindeer to deliver gifts to all the good children in the world on Christmas eve. The reality is this is just not so. Sorry to break it to you.
            The real truth is that Santa outsources much of the delivery to hundreds of his elves who each in turn use several reindeer to deliver his cargo.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now you may be thinking, well what's so bad about that?  I'll tell you what.  On Christmas eve, there will be thousands of reindeer flying through out the skies.
            And what do you think happens when a reindeer has to use the bathroom? You think it they all just making a quick landing so the reindeer can find a public toilet somewhere and do its deed? Not at all!
            The reindeer simply dump their business while in flight.  That's right! It practically rains reindeer poop all night long!  So city crews have to stay up all night cleaning up the mess!
            And another thing, on more than on occasion, an airplane has had to take evasive action just to a collision with those reindeer. Sometimes an engine goes out after sucking in some reindeer poop!
         </p>
         <p>The bottom line is that Santa, his elves and his reindeer are a menace to society!  And now it's your duty to take them out before their dooty takes us out!</p>
